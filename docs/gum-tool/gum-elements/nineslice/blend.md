# Blend

## Introduction

The Blend variable controls how the selected instance combines its colors with whatever is drawn before. The final appearance of a NineSlice depends on its Blend, Alpha, Source File, and Color values.

For more information and examples, see the [Sprite Blend page](../general-properties/blend.md).
