# Clips Children

The `Clips Children` property controls whether children of a component or container can render outside of the bounds of their parent. By default this is false, which means that all children are not clipped (can fully-render) regardless of whether they are within the bounds of their parent or not. Setting this value to true prevents children from rendering outside of the bounds of their parent.

Children outside of the bounds of a container with Clips Children set to true can also be clipped by setting a container's [Is Render Target](../container/is-render-target.md) value to true.
