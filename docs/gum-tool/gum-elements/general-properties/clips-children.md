# Clips Children

The `Clips Children` property controls whether children of a component or container can render outside of the bounds of their parent. By default this is false, which means that all children are not clipped (can fully-render) regardless of whether they are within the bounds of their parent or not. Setting this value to true prevents children from rendering outside of the bounds of their parent.
