# Y Origin

## Introduction

The **Y Origin** variable controls the point which an object is positioned by. By default the **Y Origin** is **Top**. The **Y Origin** is shown visually as a white "X" in the editor.

## Top

The following image shows a [ColoredRectangle](../coloredrectangle.md) with its **Y Origin** set to **Top**:

## Center

The following image shows a ColoredRectangle with its **Y Origin** set to **Center**:

## Bottom

The following image shows a ColoredRectangle with its **Y Origin** set to **Bottom**:

## Baseline

The following shows a Text with its Y Origin set to Baseline:

Baseline refers to the bottom of the text for letters without descenders. For more information see the [Wikipedia Baseline page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_\(typography\)).

Baseline is often used to align fonts of different sizes. The following image shows two Text instances with different font sizes. Both are positioned by their baseline so their bottoms align properly (ignoring descenders, such as on the letter p and the comma).

By contrast, the following image shows the same Text instances using bottom alignment.
