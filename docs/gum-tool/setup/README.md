### Windows

Download and unzip the .zip file and run the Gum.exe file which is located in Data/Debug/.

Since Gum is a prebuilt file in a .zip, Windows _blocks_ the file which results in the "Windows protected your PC" popup:

You can click **More info,** then **Run anyway**. Alternatively, you can right-click on the .zip file and select the option to unblock:

#### Manual Setup Steps

These following commands will go through the steps setting up your macOS or Linux environment to run the GUM tool using WINE.

1. Open a new terminal and set our wine prefix for Gum with the following command:

```sh
GUM_WINE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/.wine_gum_prefix/
```

2. Install Windows All Fonts using `winetricks` with the following command:

```sh
WINEPREFIX=$GUM_WINE_PREFIX_PATH winetricks allfonts
```

3. Install .NET Framework 4.8 using `winetricks` with the following command:

```sh
WINEPREFIX=$GUM_WINE_PREFIX_PATH winetricks dotnet48
```

This command initiates the installation of .NET Framework 4.8. A total of two installer dialogs appear one after another. Follow the steps for both to complete the installation. **This process may take a several minutes, so please be patient**.

4. Download the Gum Tool ZIP file from the FlatRedBall website and save it to your preferred location. You can download it using the following command:

```sh
curl -o Gum.zip https://files.flatredball.com/content/Tools/Gum/Gum.zip
```

5. Unzip the downloaded Gum Tool ZIP file into the Program Files directory of the WINE folder, this will also remove any existing Gum Tool installed and the zip to clean up. Run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
rm -rf $GUM_WINE_PREFIX_PATH/drive_c/Program\ Files/Gum && \
unzip Gum.zip -d $GUM_WINE_PREFIX_PATH/drive_c/Program\ Files/Gum && \
rm -f Gum.zip
```

6. Create a script to run the Gum Tool. Run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
GUM_EXE_PATH=$(find "$GUM_WINE_PREFIX_PATH" -name "Gum.exe" -type f) && \
mkdir -p $HOME/bin && \
printf '#!%s\nWINEPREFIX=%s wine "%s"\n' "/bin/bash" "$GUM_WINE_PREFIX_PATH" "$GUM_EXE_PATH" > $HOME/bin/gum && \
chmod +x ~/bin/gum
```

7. To ensure you can run the Gum Tool from any directory, add the script directory to your PATH. Most Linux and macOS users using macOS 10.14 or lower, will be using the BASH shell.

**For Bash SHELL**

```sh
if ! grep -q 'export PATH="\$HOME/bin:\$PATH"' ~/.bashrc 2>/dev/null; then
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
fi
```

**For ZSH Shell**

```sh
if ! grep -q 'export PATH="\$HOME/bin:\$PATH"' ~/.zshrc 2>/dev/null; then
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
fi
```

8. Reload the shell configuration to apply the changes. Run the following command:

**For BASH Shell**

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

**For ZSH Shell**

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Running the Gum Tool

Congratulations! You have now successfully set up the Gum Tool on Linux using WINE. You can open the Gum Tool by simply typing the following command in the terminal:

```sh
gum
```

If the command doesn't work immediately, try closing and reopening the terminal.
