title: Wrap

Introduction

The Wrap value controls whether the sprite will wrap its image when rendering portions beyond the image location. If this value is true then wrapping will occur. Otherwise, areas beyond the texture will extend the last pixel - also known as "clamping" the value.

The Wrap variable applies when dealing with a **Texture Address** of **Custom** or **DimensionsBased**.
