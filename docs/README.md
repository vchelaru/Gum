Gum is the best Game UI Layout tool available. It provides a flexible, efficient layout engine capable of producing virtually any layout. Gum can be used in a variety of contexts including in the [FlatRedBall game engine](https://docs.flatredball.com/gum/), [MonoGame](code/monogame/), [Meadow](code/meadow.md), and more. Gum can also be rendered on Skia so it can be used in any environment that supports Skia such as [WPF](code/skiagum/setup/wpf.md), [Silk.NET](code/silk.net/), and Avalonia.

The Gum layout engine can also be included in any .NET project without requiring the use of a particular graphical API.
