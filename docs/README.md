Gum is the best Game UI Layout tool available. It provides a flexible, efficient layout engine capable of producing virtually any layout. Gum can be used in a variety of contexts including in the [FlatRedBall game engine](https://docs.flatredball.com/gum/), [MonoGame](code/getting-started/setup/adding-initializing-gum/monogame-kni-fna/), [raylib](code/getting-started/setup/adding-initializing-gum/raylib-raylib-cs.md), and more. Gum can also be rendered on Skia so it can be used in any environment that supports Skia such as [WPF](code/getting-started/setup/adding-initializing-gum/wpf.md), [Silk.NET](code/silk.net), and Avalonia.

The Gum layout engine can also be included in any .NET project without requiring the use of a particular graphical API.

### Simple Integration - Gum Supports Many Runtimes

Grab the NuGet, add a few lines of code, see your Gum project in game! You can use Gum with MonoGame, KNI, FNA, raylib, SkiaSharp, and many more platforms. For more information on our runtimes, see the [Getting Started](code/getting-started/) page.
