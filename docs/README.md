# Introduction

## Important: Binaries have moved

**Binaries can now be downloaded from FlatRedBall here:**

## Source code has moved

The source code for Gum has moved to github:

[http://www.github.com/vchelaru/Gum](http://www.github.com/vchelaru/Gum)

Documentation will still \(temporarily\) be housed on CodePlex due to the complexity of adding images to the GitHub wiki.

## Project Description

Gum is a general-purpose UI tool for games, mockups, and websites. Gum saves to an XML format which you can include in your projects, but also supports a plugin system \(using MEF\) for custom exports.

Gum combines the power of programming concepts such as inheritance, instancing, and default/overriding variable values with a easy-to-use visual editor.
