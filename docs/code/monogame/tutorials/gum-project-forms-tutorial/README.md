# Gum Project Forms Tutorial

## Introduction

This series of tutorials covers how to use the Gum tool to create UI for your project. This tutorial shows how to create a _full featured_ Gum project including:

* Creating and loading a Gum project
* Using Gum's code generation for strongly-typed access to your Gum project
* Using Forms controls including Button, TextBox, and ListBox
* Navigating multiple Screens
* Styling Gum Components

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of the Gum tool. Specifically it assumes you know how to:

* Move and resize instances
* Create Screens and Entities
* Work with the Variables tab

If you are brand new to Gum, we recommend learning about how to work with the Gum tool by reading the Gum tool [Intro Tutorials](../../../../gum-tool/tutorials-and-examples/intro-tutorials/).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This tutorial series uses the Gum UI tool and loads the resulting .gumx project and its associated files. If you do not want to use the Gum tool, or if you have some restrictions (such as game IO restrictions), you may want to look at code-only projects. These are discussed in the [Code-Only Gum Forms Tutorial](../code-only-gum-forms-tutorial/) series.
