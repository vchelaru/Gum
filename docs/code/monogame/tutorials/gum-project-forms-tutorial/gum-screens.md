# Gum Screens

## Introduction

Gum screens are _top level_ items which can contain instances of Gum objects. We'll be creating our first Gum screen in this tutorial. We'll also load this screen in code and work with gum objects.

## Creating a Screen in the Gum Tool

To add a new Screen:

1. Open the project in the Gum tool
2.  Right-click on the Screens folder and select Add Screen

3.  Name the screen TitleScreen and click OK

    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (100).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enter the new screen name and click OK</p></figcaption></figure>

The newly created TitleScreen is now in the Screens folder.

## Adding Instances

We can add new instances to Gum Screen by drag+dropping the files onto the Game screen.

Add a ButtonStandard to TitleScreen.

Instances can also be created by selecting the TitleScreen, then drag+dropping the item in the editor window.

Add a second ButtonStandard instance by dropping Components/Controls/ButtonStandard onto TitleScreen.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/10_05 27 50.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Drag+drop a component onto the Editor tab to add it to TitleScreen</p></figcaption></figure>

Be sure to select the TitleScreen first, then drag+drop. If you click the component instead, then it will be selected, so you must re-select the TitleScreen.

The Gum tool includes lots of functionality for creating and customizing UI. For a more complete tutorial covering the Gum tool, see the [Gum Tool Intro Tutorials](../../../../gum-tool/tutorials-and-examples/intro-tutorials/). Feel free to spend some time creating your TitleScreen.

## Setting Up Code Generation

Code generation reduces the amount of code you have to write to work with Gum. It results in strongly-typed screens and components, reducing the chances of typos and catching errors at runtime.

To set up code generation for your project:

1. Select a Screen such as TitleScreen - the Code tab does not appear unless a Screen or Component is selected
2. Click on the Code tab
3.  Click the **Auto Setup Code Generation** button\


    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/10_05 34 13.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
4. Gum locates your .csproj file and sets up default values.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/29_15 00 30.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Code tab in Gum</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you do not see the Auto Setup Code Generation button, that means you saved your Gum project in a location that is not relative to your game's .csproj. Be sure to save Gum projects in a subfolder of where your .csproj is located, usually in a folder in side the Content folder.
{% endhint %}

Once you have set this up, you can click the Generate Code button to generate code for your TitleScreen.&#x20;

Note that Gum also generates code for all components referenced by your project, so it also generates ButtonStandard. If asked, click **Yes** to generate all necessary components.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/29_15 02 23.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Generate Code and click Yes to generate all components referenced by the TitleScreen</p></figcaption></figure>

You can verify that your code has been properly generated by looking at your project in Visual Studio or your IDE of choice.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/29_15 04 15.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>ButtonStandard and TitleScreen classes</p></figcaption></figure>

Note that each screen and component generates two .cs files:

1. YourComponentOrScreenName.cs - this is called _custom code_ and is where you can write code safely
2. YourComponentOrScreenName.Generated.cs - this is called _generated code_ and is written by Gum. This code will be re-generated when you make changes in Gum, so if you write any code here it will be lost on re-generation.

## Showing a Gum Screen in Your Game

To show the TitleScreen in game, we can use the newly-generated TitleScreen class as shown in the following snippet:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Full Code" %}
```csharp
protected override void Initialize()
{
    GumUI.Initialize(this, "GumProject/GumProject.gumx");

    var screen = new TitleScreen();
    screen.AddToRoot();

    base.Initialize();
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Diff" %}
```diff
protected override void Initialize()
{
    GumUI.Initialize(this, "GumProject/GumProject.gumx");

+   var screen = new TitleScreen();
+   screen.AddToRoot();

    base.Initialize();
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The game now displays the TitleScreen.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/29_15 08 40.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>TitleScreen displayed in a MonoGame project</p></figcaption></figure>

The new code has 2 calls:

* new TitleScreen() - this instantiates the TitleScreen using the generated code. As mentioned above, this is a type-safe way to access the Gum screen. Note that it is possible to access the screen using strings as well, but doing so can be more error prone.
* screen.AddToRoot() - this call adds the screen to the root Gum object so that it is drawn and so it receives events. For example, we can mouse over and click on our buttons and they respond visually.

## Accessing Instances in Code

We can access the buttons in our TitleScreen using the generated code. We can access the buttons in our Game1 class, or we can access them in the TitleScreen.cs file. Both are perfectly fine, and which you do depends on whether you intend to have the Gum screen contained in a higher-level object that is specific to your game (such as a game scene), or if you want to keep all Gum code within the screen's custom code file. Either way, the code to interact with items is similar.

For example, the following code could be used to set the time when a button was clicked in the Game class. Notice that we access the button using the same name as is given in the Gum screen. If you changed the name of your button to something other than ButtonStandardInstance, then you should use that new name in code too:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Full Code" %}
```csharp
// In your Game class:
protected override void Initialize()
{
    GumUI.Initialize(this, "GumProject/GumProject.gumx");

    var screen = new TitleScreen();
    screen.ButtonStandardInstance.Click += (_, _) =>
        screen.ButtonStandardInstance.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString();
    screen.AddToRoot();

    base.Initialize();
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Diff" %}
<pre class="language-diff"><code class="lang-diff">// In your Game class:
protected override void Initialize()
{
    GumUI.Initialize(this, "GumProject/GumProject.gumx");

    var screen = new TitleScreen();
<strong>+   screen.ButtonStandardInstance.Click += (_, _) =>
</strong>+       screen.ButtonStandardInstance.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString();
    screen.AddToRoot();

    base.Initialize();
}
</code></pre>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The button now responds to clicks by updating its text.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/29_15 15 48.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Button updating its Text to the current time</p></figcaption></figure>

Alternatively, you can write code directly in the TitleScreen. Remember, TitleScreen.cs exists so you can write your own code. It contains a CustomInitialize method which is called when the Screen is first created. We can assign events in CustomInitialize as shown in the following code snippet:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Full Code" %}
<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="lang-csharp">partial class TitleScreen
{
    partial void CustomInitialize()
    {
<strong>        ButtonStandardInstance1.Click += (_, _) =>
</strong>            ButtonStandardInstance1.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString();
    }
}
</code></pre>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Diff" %}
<pre class="language-diff"><code class="lang-diff">partial class TitleScreen
{
    partial void CustomInitialize()
    {
<strong>+       ButtonStandardInstance1.Click += (_, _) =>
</strong>+           ButtonStandardInstance1.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString();
    }
}
</code></pre>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Remember, add your code to CustomInitialize, not the constructor.

## Conclusion
