# ModalRoot and PopupRoot

### Introduction

The static `ModalRoot` and `PopupRoot` properties provide an `InteractiveGue` which serve as the root for any element which should appear on top of other elements. These properties have the following characteristics:

* Automatically created by `Gum.Initialize`
* Automatically resized to fit the entire screen, including if the `GraphicalUiElement.CanvasHeight` and `GraphicalUiElement.CanvasWidth` change.
* Both remain on top of all other elements for its given layer. ModalRoot appears on top of PopupRoot.

These properties can be used in custom code to place elements (such as custom popup and toast elements) above all other elements.

`ModalRoot` and `PopupRoot` act as alternative root objects which can hold controls. Controls which are added to either of these two roots should not be added to the default GumService `Root` property - doing so would result in a control being drawn and updated twice per frame.

### Modal Popups

Popups which are placed on the ModalRoot element are considered _modal_ - they block the input of all other controls. This is useful if you would like to create a popup which must be clicked before any other elements receive input. If multiple elements are added to ModalRoot, only the last item (and its children) receive input events. This allows one popup to show another popup.

By contrast, elements added to the PopupRoot are not modal - other elements can receive input.

### Example - Adding a Popup

The following code can be used to display a popup to either ModalRoot or PopupRoot depending on the `isModal` value.

```csharp
// assuming popupButton is valid:
popupButton.Click += (_,_) =>
{
    ShowPopup(isModal:true);
};
// Define ShowPopup
private void ShowPopup(string text, bool isModal)
{
    
private void ShowPopup(string text, bool isModal)
{
    var container = isModal ? 
        FrameworkElement.ModalRoot : FrameworkElement.PopupRoot;

    var button = new Button();
    button.Text = "Close Me";
    button.Width = 200;
    button.Height = 200;
    var buttonVisual = button.Visual;
    buttonVisual.YOrigin = RenderingLibrary.Graphics.VerticalAlignment.Center;
    buttonVisual.YUnits = Gum.Converters.GeneralUnitType.PixelsFromMiddle;
    buttonVisual.XOrigin = RenderingLibrary.Graphics.HorizontalAlignment.Center;
    buttonVisual.XUnits = Gum.Converters.GeneralUnitType.PixelsFromMiddle;
    container.Children.Add(button.Visual);
    button.Click += (_, _) =>
    {
        buttonVisual.RemoveFromManagers();
        buttonVisual.Parent = null;
    };
}


```

### Example - Adding a Popup from Gum Element

Popups can also be created if your game is loading a Gum project. Since the GraphicalUiElement will be added to either ModalRoot or PopupRoot, it should not also be added to managers.

```csharp
var popupComponent = gumProject.Components.First(item => item.Name == "MyPopup")
    .ToGraphicalUiElement();

popupComponent.Parent = FrameworkElement.ModalRoot;

// later, the popup can be removed:
popupComponent.RemoveFromManagers();
popupComponent.Parent = null;
```

If you are going to add a Screen to a ModalRoot, then the Screen must have a renderable contained object so that it can have its Parent assigned. You can do this by creating a Screen runtime which inherits from ContainerBase, or you can optionally add an InvisibleRenderable as shown in the following code:

```csharp
var popupScreen = gumProject.Screens.First(item => item.Name == "MyScreen")
    .ToGraphicalUiElement();
popupScreen.Parent = FrameworkElement.ModalRoot;

// later, the popup can be removed:
popupScreen.RemoveFromManagers();
popupScreen.Parent = null;
```
