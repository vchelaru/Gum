# ElementSave

### Introduction

ElementSave is the base class for ScreenSave, ComponentSave, and StandardElementSave. ElementSave is often used when working with instances of the derived classes due to their similarities, such as referencing instances, states, or converting the ElementSave to a GraphicalUiElement at runtime.
