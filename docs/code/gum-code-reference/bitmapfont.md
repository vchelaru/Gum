# BitmapFont

## Introduction

`BitmapFont` is the runtime representation of a .fnt file and its accompanying textures (usually loaded from .png). A `BitmapFont` includes an array of `BitmapCharacterInfo`, where each represents one character in the font. A `BitmapFont` also includes an array of `Texture2Ds`, each of which represents one page from the exported .pngs.
