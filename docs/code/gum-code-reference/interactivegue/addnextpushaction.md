# AddNextPushAction

## Introduction

AddNextPushAction adds a delegate to be raised the next time the Cursor performs a primary push. This call is not bound to a particular control, and it can be used to handle the user pushes off of the control.  This method is used internally to close Menus and ComboBoxes, but it can be used to close custom popups, modals, and context menus.
