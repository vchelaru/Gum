# Dock

## Introduction

Dock is a method providing a shortcut for setting values to position and size an instance according to its parents or children. This function mimicks the Dock section of the Alignment tab in the Gum UI tool. For examples and information about which variables are assigned, see the [Dock page](../../../gum-tool/gum-elements/general-properties/dock.md).
