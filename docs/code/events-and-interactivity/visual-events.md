# Visual Events

## Introduction

Visuals in Gum provide a large number of events. Most Forms events are based on the events provided by their underlying visuals. Visual events may be needed if you intend to:

* Handle events specific to certain visuals
* Create custom controls, such as a button "from scratch"
* Access events on controls which normally do not have events, such as click events on a Label
