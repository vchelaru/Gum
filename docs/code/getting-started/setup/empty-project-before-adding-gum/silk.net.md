# Silk.NET

## Introduction

Gum can be used in Silk projects by importing Gum's SkiaSharp NuGet package. To get a Silk.NET project set up, see the Silk.NET documentation: [https://dotnet.github.io/Silk.NET/docs/v3/](https://dotnet.github.io/Silk.NET/docs/v3/)

Next, you can begin adding Gum to your project. For more information see the [Adding/Initializing Gum](../adding-initializing-gum/silk.net.md) page.
