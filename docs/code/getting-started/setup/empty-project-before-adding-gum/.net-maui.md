# .NET MAUI

## Introduction

Gum can be used to create visuals in a Skia canvas in .NET MAUI projects. For more information setting up a new .NET MAUI project see the Microsoft Learn .NET MAUI page: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/maui](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/maui)

Once you have a .NET MAUI app set up, you should have a XAML page that you can use to test Gum. For example, you may have a page named `MainPage.xaml`

Next, you can begin adding Gum to your project. For more information see the [Adding/Initializing Gum](../adding-initializing-gum/.net-maui.md) page.
