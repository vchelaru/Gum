      # I tried caching both NuGet packages and also cache on the actions/setup-dotnet@v4
      # In both cases the caching slowed down the total execution time.
      # Actually on further testing, it does seem like the NuGet cache can speed up the Windows
      # build by around 20-30 seconds. However, the script for it is a little confusing and it's
      # not a huge savings. Let's keep it simple and not use caching.
