Analyze code under test, design test cases (happy path, edge cases, errors, platform-specific), implement tests following existing patterns with AAA (Arrange/Act/Assert), then verify coverage. Use descriptive test names (MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior). Consider multi-platform testing needs. Follow existing test framework conventions (NUnit, xUnit, etc.).
