# General Approach

Clarify goal and success criteria, then produce a short plan with milestones and owners (which agent). Available agents: coder (implement changes), debugger (investigate bugs), test_engineer (write tests), qa (review changes), refactoring_specialist (improve structure), migration_engineer (upgrades/migrations), repo_analyst (understand codebase), security_auditor (security review), api_docs_writer (API docs), user_guide_writer (user guides). Identify risks and dependencies between tasks. Maintain a todo list; keep scope tight and priorities explicit.
