# Introduction 

Gum is a general purpose UI layout tool built on object-oriented principles.

Specifically it supports:

* Inheritance
* Object instances
* Default/overriding variables
* States (categorized and uncategorized)
* Incredibly flexible layout engine

Gum exports to human-readable XML, and can be extended either using MEF or by modifying the source code directly.

## Platforms

Gum produces genera-purpose XML so it is technically possible to use Gum in any environment. That said, a number of runtimes exist to make integration into your project much easier.

Gum integrations exist for the following environments:

* MonoGame/FNA/Kni
* FlatRedBall
* Meadow
* SkiaSharp
* WPF
* Xamarin.Forms/Maui

For details on integrating Gum with these runtimes, or for using GumCore to integrate with your own runtime, see the main documentation: https://docs.flatredball.com/gum/
